# PM-Dungeon

I've created a Java game called PM-Dungeon with my team.
This was a group assignment at our college where we had to push our progress onto a private GitLab.
This is a copy of the project's progress.
Therefore, you won't see the commits of my teammates.

This game is about a hero who slashes his way through dungeon monsters and traps while gaining EXP, potions and useful weapons on the way.

## Instructions
Accept quests = J
Show accepted quests = O
Show inventory = I
Equip items = E, then 1 or 2 (depending on which hand should hold the given item)
Drop Item = Q, then "number_of_current_pos_of_item_in_inv"
A = Go left
S = Go down
W = Go up
D = Go right

The project's SDK version is 16.

## Here's the game in action:
