# PM-Dungeon

I've created a Java game called PM-Dungeon with my team.
This was a group assignment at our college where we had to push our progress onto a private GitLab.
This is a copy of the project's progress.
Therefore, you won't see the commits of my teammates.

This game is about a hero who slashes his way through dungeon monsters and traps while gaining EXP, potions and useful weapons on the way.

The project's SDK version is 16.
